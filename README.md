# MQTT Client Examples

This repository contains examples of MQTT clients using the MQTT 3.1, 3.1.1, and 5.0 protocols. You can use these examples to learn about the MQTT protocol and how to use MQTT clients with any MQTT broker.

**IMPORTANT SECURITY TIP**: Before submitting any code changes, please change your username and password to "emqx/public" in the examples' configuration files. This will prevent any unintended access to your MQTT broker.

## MQTT Broker for Testing

If you want to test these examples, you can use the MQTT broker provided by EMQ X at `broker.emqx.io`. Please note that this is a public broker and should not be used for production.

The broker supports the following protocols:

- Broker: broker.emqx.io
- TCP Port: 1883
- WebSocket Port: 8083
- SSL/TLS Port: 8883
- WebSocket Secure Port: 8084
